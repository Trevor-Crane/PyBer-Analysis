# PyBer-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
This project will give us an analysis for three major city types, Urban, Suburban, and Rural, for the app company PyBer. We will be using Python for our data analysis. More specifically, we are using Jupyter Notebook for the analysis, while using Matplotlib for graphs. For each city type, we will determin the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, averave fare per driver, and the total fare by city type.

## Results
After analyizing the date, we have determined the following. 
  * Rural cities: We found that there were 125 total rides, 78 total drivers, a total of $4,327.93 in fares, with an average fare per ride of $34.62, as well as an     average fare of $55.49 per driver.
  * Suburban cities: We found that there were 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, a total of $19,356.33 in fares, with an average fare per ride of $30.97, as well as an average fare of $39.50 per driver.
  * Urban cities: We found that there were 1625 total rides, 2.405 total drivers, a total of $39,854.38 in total fares, with an average fare per ride of $24.53, as well as an average fare of $16.57 per driver.

We then tracked the total data throughout the first four months of the year 2019, determining the total fare per week for each city type, and came up with this graph:

As we can see, urban city types constantly brings in about three times as much fares as rural types, bringing in about twice the amount of suburban cities.

## Summary
As we can see, there is quite the disparity when comparing the three city types. Here are three suggestions in trying lessen them.
  * Try lowering the fare price in Rural citeis. Although there are far fewer total rides, they spend an average of $10 more per ride. Lowering this could convinse more people to use the app.
  * Urban cities have more than twice the amount of total rides as suburban and rural types combined. Perhaps promoting the app more in these locations will garner more rides later on.
  * There are more than 30x the amount of drivers in urban areas than there are in rural, and nearly 5x as many drivers than suburban areas. Getting more drivers for our app could mean more business opportunities in these areas.
